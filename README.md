This project is based on the work of [Spconv](https://github.com/traveller59/spconv). We propsed a noval method which operates on Voxels called Sparse Voxel Shuffle.

## TODO:
(1) Support different layout on voxels.
(2) Support using CUDA in backend imeplement for better efficient.
(3) Integrated with Spconv Project.
